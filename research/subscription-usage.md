# Subscription usage in the context popover (#159)

The account capacity section is separate from context occupancy and appears in
both app purposes. Session total, Last turn, and the structured context breakdown
retain their existing coding-purpose gate. Missing measurements show “No
subscription usage reported yet.”, without a meter.

## Provider contract

Based on the owner's probes of 2026-09-13; this implementation does not run new
provider probes or model turns to obtain capacity.

- Grok: `_x.ai/billing`, with `{}` parameters. Only
  `config.creditUsagePercent` and `config.currentPeriod.{type,start,end}` are
  consumed. The measured period is weekly, and that is the only label we claim:
  `creditUsagePercent` sits on `config` rather than on the period, so an
  unrecognized period type keeps the number under the neutral label "Current
  period" instead of blanking the panel for a plan we have never seen. A missing
  or non-string type is still rejected. The optional-method handling latches
  `-32601` for the lifetime of the process and logs the missing capability once.
- Claude: `usage_update._meta["_claude/rateLimit"]`, on the update itself, passes
  through `normalizeClaudeUpdate`. A parent-session event replaces the last
  named window; ordinary usage updates without this metadata leave it alone.
  `utilization` is a fraction (0..1); `resetsAt` is Unix seconds. The fraction
  is **measured**, not inferred from the typing, because the SDK's other
  `utilization` — `SDKControlGetUsageResponse.rate_limits`, behind `/usage` —
  is documented "0-100" and rendered as a percent by the adapter. Same word,
  opposite scale. In the shipped Claude binary `rate_limit_info` is built from
  the `anthropic-ratelimit-unified-*` response headers and the CLI's own key
  for those objects is `Math.round(utilization * 100)`. Labels distinguish
  five-hour, weekly, Opus, Sonnet, included overage, and overage windows. The SDK
  may omit reset time and never supplies period start here: these remain absent,
  with an explicit “Reset time not reported.” when necessary. A new Claude
  process starts empty, even if another process reported a window previously.
- Codex supplies no ACP subscription surface. There is no fallback to `/status`
  or `/usage`, nor any Codex-specific acquisition path.

## Cache and delivery

`src/subscription-usage.ts` normalizes fresh objects containing only
`usedPercent`, `label`, `periodType`, optional `periodStart`/`periodEnd`, and
`observedAt`. Never forward `config`, subscription tier, balances, on-demand
amounts, unified-billing flags, or billing-period dates. In particular,
`billingPeriodEnd` is not the reset boundary.

Grok reads share a memory-only cache under an opaque digest of the credential
context: provider, effective auth home, relevant environment overrides, and auth
file contents. Claude observations stay process-local because OS keychain
identity is not portably readable. Digests and credentials never cross the wire.
Sign-out or a credential failure invalidates bindings; subsequent snapshots and
events also check for file/environment changes and discard late responses.
Unreadable credential files cannot yield a reusable context.

An invalidated process is not rebound: the CLI can retain the old login. A fresh
session process binds the new context. This deliberately also clears observations
on credential-file token rotation; distinguishing rotation from an account switch
without a portable identity contract is left to the provider. An external switch
held only in Claude's OS keychain requires restarting that CLI session.

`refreshSubscriptionUsage` requests a read on a real popover open, and the host
also reads at session startup. Grok's minimum interval is 60 seconds, including
failed attempts, with in-flight coalescing. There are no refresh timers: auxiliary
ACP responses re-arm pending prompt idle timers, so polling would mask a hung
prompt. Existing `refreshContextDetails` traffic does not refresh subscription
usage. Incoming UI frames only redraw this section.

The dedicated `subscriptionUsage { windows: [...] }` message mirrors to an
authenticated phone under the session's project scope. It is transient and never
enters transcript buffers, persisted history, or exports. `sessionUiSnapshot`
and history snapshot delivery send the latest value (including an empty list),
so reconnects and focus changes cannot recover old billing snapshots.

## Verification

`subscription-usage.test.ts`, `subscription-usage.dom.test.ts`, and the ACP client
tests cover normalization, explicit remote field omissions, unsupported methods,
credential changes and late responses, cache coalescing without timers, the
Claude update/envelope distinction, singular replacement, empty states, independent
context occupancy, both app purposes, and reconnect snapshots.
