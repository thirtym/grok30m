/**
 * This runs on the UI thread — of a phone — so a pathological file must not be
 * able to wedge it. Twice now it could:
 *
 *  - CSS's property rule had no left anchor, so it was retried at every
 *    position and each attempt ran to end of input and backtracked a character
 *    at a time: 40KB took 2.3s, 80KB 45s, 160KB 201s.
 *  - Every STRING rule had the same shape for a different reason: an
 *    unterminated quote made the match fail, so the scan restarted at the next
 *    quote, and the next. The same 60KB blob took 1638ms without its closing
 *    quote and 4ms with it.
 *
 * Both are quadratic, and `MAX_HIGHLIGHT_BYTES` bounds the input, not the work.
 *
 * HOW IT MEASURES, and this took three attempts to get right — worth recording,
 * because each attempt failed in a way that looked like the previous fix.
 *
 *  1. An absolute budget at a small size. A shape timing 59ms alone hit 2003ms
 *     under vitest's parallel load, so the budget had to be loosened; loosened,
 *     it no longer caught the string defect, which fit inside it at that size.
 *  2. A ratio — does doubling the input more than double the time. Immune to
 *     machine speed, but not to a single GC landing in one of the two samples:
 *     a healthy 3ms baseline drifting to 45ms reads as "15x". Ten provably
 *     linear shapes failed.
 *  3. What is here now. The signal being hunted is ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE — the
 *     regressions measured 40KB/2.3s, 160KB/201s, 60KB/1638ms-vs-4ms — so the
 *     input is sized to make a quadratic rule take SECONDS while a linear one
 *     takes milliseconds, and the budget sits in the wide gap between. Best of
 *     three suppresses the GC spikes that defeated attempt 2.
 *
 * The trap common to 1 and 2 was measuring something close to what a healthy
 * run costs. Nothing here is a benchmark: `quotes only` legitimately spends
 * most of its time ALLOCATING (its markup is ~35x its input), and that cost is
 * real, linear, and none of this test's business.
