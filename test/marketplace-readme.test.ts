/**
 * `README.marketplace.md` is GENERATED from `README.md` by
 * `scripts/gen-marketplace-readme.cjs`, and it is what `vsce package
 * --readme-path` ships — i.e. the VS Code Marketplace and Open VSX listing.
 *
 * Two failure modes, both of which had actually happened by 2026-08-09 and
 * neither of which anything noticed:
 *
 *  1. The generator injected a clean extension-only Install/Quick start pair
 *     and then appended the body from `## Requirements` onward — which still
 *     contained README.md's OWN Install and Quick start. The live listing
 *     printed both headings twice.
 *  2. `## Companion apps` had been hand-added to the output file. Since the
 *     output is generated, running the script deleted it. A hand-edit here is
 *     not a fix; it is a change that survives until the next regeneration.
 *
 * So: assert the committed file is exactly what the generator produces, and
 * assert the generator's own output has no duplicated headings.
