 * Built into a real Electron Tray in main.ts, in the same shape as
 * {@link ./app-menu} — the decisions live here so they can be unit-tested
 * without spawning Electron, and main.ts only does the Electron calls.
 *
 * WHY THERE IS A TRAY (#174). The desktop app is the thing that holds the
 * agent's sessions and, when the machine is linked, the remote uplink a phone
 * talks to. Closing the window quit the whole process, so "get this off my
 * screen" and "stop being reachable from my phone" were the same gesture, and
 * only the destructive reading was available. A tray separates them.
 *
 * WINDOWS AND LINUX ONLY, and macOS is a gap rather than a platform that
 * needs nothing — see `../tray-support`, which owns the rule and the reason.
 * In short: this app quits on `window-all-closed` everywhere, so a Mac window
 * close still ends it, and the macOS answer is the dock rather than a menu-bar
 * item.

/**
 * Whether a window close should hide to the tray instead of closing.
 *
 * `quitting` is the one that matters and is easy to forget: Quit from the tray
 * menu, the app menu and the auto-updater's relaunch all arrive as
 * `before-quit` followed by a window close. Without this the close would be
 * cancelled and the app would refuse to exit — a process the person can only
 * kill from Task Manager, which is a far worse bug than the one the tray fixes.
 *
 * A Windows shutdown, restart or logout does NOT arrive that way: Electron
 * documents `before-quit` as not emitted for it. The caller must therefore set
 * `quitting` from the window's Windows-only `session-end` event as well — miss
 * that and closing to the tray leaves the app holding up the machine's
 * shutdown, on the one platform where the tray is on by default.
 *
 * `trayPresent` is the other one, and it is not the same question as
 * `trayEnabled`. Constructing a Tray throws on a Linux session with no
 * StatusNotifier host, and there are Windows configurations that hide the
 * notification area entirely. Hiding a window when nothing can bring it back
 * is the invisible-app trap: the app is running, reachable from the phone, and
 * unreachable from the desk it is running on. So the hide is conditional on the
 * icon actually existing, and a failed tray simply means closing quits, which
 * is what the app did before any of this.
